My name is Arthur. And today we’re going to talk about Scrum.  
`(Slide - Scrum is for managing)`  
From the very beginning we say that it’s about managing complex projects.  
`(Slide - Why Scrum)`  
You might ask yourself a question why should you use actually Scrum but not something else. And that’s a good question I can say.  
`(Slide - Vision)`  
Let’s talk about vision. It’s mean that we need to look at the product from the side of customer.  
`(Slide - Roadmap)`  
Our product looks like set of features that makes roadmap. But we actually have not a road map we have something like wishlist. It’s because all the features based on the information that 	available to you now.  
`(Slide - Inevitable changes )`  
All of that mean that you’re going to have inevitable changes. What is really important is to get feedback quick enough. If you get it quick enough you’ll be able not to redo a huge part of the product.  
`(Slide - Close to you )`  
In the way if that close to you and all that was mentioned describe your current product or future one. Then Scrum is what you likely to be want to use.  
`(Slide - How does it work )`  
You might ask ‘So how does it work?’.  
`(Slide - Roles )`  
Here we have 3 roles: product owner, team and scrum master.  
`(Slide – Product owner )`  
Let’s imagine that product owner it’s just a man. And he answers on the questions like: ‘What we should do to make this product?’ and ‘Why we should do this or that’.  
Moreover what is really important for him is to make everything as fast as it’s possible.  
`(Slide – Team )`  
Team of developers answers on the questions like: ‘How to do some feature?’ & ‘When can we make done all of the work?’. Moreover they try to do everything with appropriate volume of quality.  
And here we have I problem. Why? The problem is that product owner (PO in advance) wants to make everything fast to get outcomes from the product as quick as it’s possible. But if we work in a hurry we’re going to have problems with quality.  
`(Slide – Scrum master )`  
For that reason we have scrum master. He’s truing to balance all of that. Moreover he helps team to stay focused on the goals. He supports team and couches both team and PO.  
`(Slide – Artifacts )`  
Here he have product backlog, sprint backlog, burndown chart.  
`(Slide – Product backlog)`  
Product backlog is a set of features that product owner sees that we need to implement to make product just right. After this he need to prioritize all of that features. So we get prioritized list of all features.  
`(Slide – Sprint backlog)`  
The most important features from the top of the list we bring to the sprint backlog. Here team can look at them and make real tasks with technical requirements. Team estimates this chunk of tasks by time.  
`(Slide – Burndown chart)`  
Burndown chart is for daily monitoring are we quick enough to meet our deadline and to make everything that was planned before or not. Here we got work that is remaining and time that left. As we draw this chart we can see trend. This trend shows us if we move with the right path or not. In fact this trend is rate of productivity.  
`(Slide – Ceremonies)`  
Scrum has 3 ceremonies: sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review.  
`(Slide – Sprint planning)`  
Sprint planning is for planning sprint. It helps to understand what to do and in which period of time.  
`(Slide – Daily scrum)`  
Daily scrum helps for every team member to stay focused on goals. On this meeting every one answers on 3 questions. They are ‘what did I do yesterday’ ‘What I’m going to do today’ ‘If there some stoppers or blockers’.  
`(Slide – Sprint review)`  
Here product owner askes what team has done. In the end of every sprint team should represent potential shippable product.
`(Slide – Brining all together)`  
Let’s brining all together . At the beginning product owner should make product backlog. Moreover he should prioritize this set of features. That helps to understand what is really important for now. Features from the top of product backlog list go to sprint backlog. Now team can estimate all that work and turn them into tasks to do. Here sprint starts. On this stage of work team should have daily scrum to stay focused and to talk about work process. At the end team represents potentially shippable product. Potentially mean that product owner can decide if we can add these features to product or not yet.  
`(Slide – What do you get)`  
With Scrum we have constant communication. That really helps to solve problems. As we get potentially shippable product after every iterations we can get constant feedback. All of that makes us ready for any changes if they required.  
So if you have complex project and from the start you don’t know how features should look like then try to use scrum.  
`(Slide – Thank you)`  
Thank you
